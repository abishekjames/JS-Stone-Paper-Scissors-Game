# JS-Stone-Paper-Scissors-Game
In this project, I have made a Rock Paper Scissors game. The html will be barebone,and I used javascript to play this in the console. I have structured 
the javascript and created some important functions and variables. Also,will be asking the user for their "choice" and will be having the computer select 
their choice as well.I have used for and while loops to validate the user input. I have set up all in console logs.You can play this cool game! The game has 5 rounds.
